## Usage Guide

### Loading Data

1. Click the "Load File" button
2. Select your Excel file
3. Specify the sheet name and column names for time and fluorescence data
4. Choose whether to analyze evoked or miniature events
5. Choose whether to convert to ΔF/F format

### Peak Detection

1. Click the "Detect Peaks" button
2. Set detection parameters:
   - Peak threshold
   - Minimum distance between peaks
   - Peak width
3. Review detected peaks
4. Manually add or remove peaks by clicking on the plot
5. Review all the fitted curves
6. For peaks with poor decay fitting, right-click "Decay Time" in the table and click recalculate

### Evoked Response Analysis
This feature is only applicable to evoked data.
1. Click "Partition Evoked Data"
2. Set partition parameters:
   - Number of peaks per interval
   - Interval size
   - Offset
3. Review partitioned segments
4. Export results using the export button
